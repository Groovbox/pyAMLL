Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup un/til it over/flowed
Took it so far to keep you clo/se 
(keep you close)
I was af/raid to leave you on your own
I said I'd catch you if you fall
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
(all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take ad/van/tage of me
Tell me how's it feel sitt/in' up there?
Feel/ing so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lone/ly?
Thin/king you could li/ve with/out me
Thin/king you could li/ve with/out me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
(yeah, I don't know why)
Thin/king you could li/ve with/out me
Li/ve with/out me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
(I don't know why, yeah yeah)
Gave love 'bout a hun/dred tries 
(hundred tries)
Just runn/ing from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine 
(made 'em mine)
I didn't no/tice 'cause my love was blind
Said I'd catch you if you fall 
(fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
(all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you can take ad/van/tage of me
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feel/ing so high but too far a/way to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lone/ly?
Thin/king you could li/ve with/out me
Thin/king you could li/ve with/out me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
(yeah, I don't know why)
Thin/king you could li/ve with/out me
Li/ve with/out me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah
You don't have to say just what you did
I already know 
(I know)
I had to go and find out from them
So tell me how's it feel 
(oh-whoa)
Tell me how's it feel sitt/in' up there?
Feel/ing so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lone/ly?
Thin/king you could li/ve with/out me
Thin/king you could li/ve with/out me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why
